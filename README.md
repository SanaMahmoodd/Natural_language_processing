#Natural Language Processing Project

This project aims to evaluate a news article using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It allows users to input a news article URL and retrieve results based on NLP analysis.

## Features
- Evaluate text content from a given news article URL.
- Process text and provide insights.
- Show processed results in a user-friendly interface.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SanaMahmoodd/Natural_language_processing.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Natural_language_processing
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server will be available at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) (or the port you specify).

## Webpack Configuration
This project uses Webpack to bundle the application files for both development and production environments.

### Development Setup
To run the project in development mode (with hot reloading and source maps):

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will build the project and run the development server, typically available at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

### Production Build
To create a production build of the project, which is optimized for performance:

1. **Run the production build command:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

This will bundle the files and optimize them for deployment.

## Webpack Config Files
The Webpack configuration files are located in:

- **webpack.config.js:** Base Webpack configuration.
- **webpack.dev.js:** Development-specific configurations (such as source maps and live-reloading).
- **webpack.prod.js:** Production-specific configurations (such as minification and optimization).

## Usage
1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Enter the URL of a news article you want to evaluate.
3. Click on the Submit button.
4. View the NLP analysis results.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **Webpack**
- **Natural Language Processing libraries (e.g., NLP.js, others)**
